# Fullstack Project
This project allows users to create an account and log in. Upon successful validation when logging in, the backend generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) which is subsequently 
used for all API calls to the backend. The main features of the project include the ability for users to create folders, add and view pictures/images within those 
folders, and view them in a modal view. Users also have the option to delete pictures, folders, and their entire account.
